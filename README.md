## Overview

This project is a Plant Disease Detector that utilizes OpenCV, a Roboflow image detection model, and a Streamlit framework. The detector aims to identify and classify diseases in plants using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Image Detection:** Utilizes Roboflow's pre-trained model for accurate and efficient plant disease detection.
- **OpenCV Integration:** Leverages OpenCV for image processing and analysis.
- **User Interface with Streamlit:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for running the detector.
